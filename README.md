# Coin_Villagers_2

A UE5 game project that allowed me to learn the following parts of the engine:

Physics    (Pretty much everything I could meet as logical challenges, I overcame)
Blueprints (Work with Vectors, collision, vars, diff data types, operators, return types, booleans, branches, functions and pure functions, Member functions)
Input      (Input Actions, Enhanced Input later)
Animation  (Anim blueprints, Timelines in blueprints, Locomotion, blend spaces, skeleton meshes)
Materials  (Material creation, troubleshooting related to them)
Sound      (metasounds mixers, attenuations)
Lighting   (world light settings, other light stuff)
UI         (Widgets, 3D menus)

And a little of other stuff I probably forgot to mention here!
