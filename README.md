# Coin_Villagers_2

A UE5 game project that allowed me to learn the following parts of the engine:

PHYSICS:    (Pretty much everything I could meet as logical challenges that I overcame);

BLUEPRINTS: (Work with Vectors, collision, vars, diff data types, operators, return types, booleans, branches, functions and pure functions, member functions);

INPUT:      (Input Actions, Enhanced Input later);

ANIMATION:  (Anim blueprints, Timelines in blueprints, Locomotion, blend spaces, skeleton meshes);

MATERIALS:  (Material creation, troubleshooting related to them);

SOUND:      (metasounds mixers, attenuations);

LIGHTING:   (world light settings, other light stuff);

UI:         (Widgets, 3D menus);

And a little of other stuff I probably forgot to mention here!
